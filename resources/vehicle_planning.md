# Vehicle Planning

* Design Decision: Figure out which end is forward. Draw a clear arrow on the board pointing forward. Make sure your whole team agrees on this decision.
* Decorate your chassis! May as well. You have markers and stickers -- pass it around & make it your own!
* Component Layout: figure out where your major components are going to fit on the chassis. Pay attention to:
    * Raspberry Pi
    * Wheel locations
        * **Design Decision**: Discuss as a team if you want to use one castor wheel or two. Either way is fine, but have the discussion. Screw them into place.
    * USB battery location
    * AA battery location
    * L298N location
    
    **NOTE**: Feel free to mark the board up using your Sharpie.

Feel free to pick a new team name. If you do, make sure you tell Mr. Bowman what your new name is.
