# Building "Robby": A Simple Guide

_by Mr. Bowman_

This guide has my name on it, but is lovingly based on the wonderful guide found [on raspberrypi.org](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/build-a-buggy). In some cases, I have even copied & pasted their guide's text. :) It's not plagiarism; maybe this as a modern example of pseudopigraphy.
