# ccr_robotics_fall_2020

Course materials for 2020-21 robotics class at [Cornerstone Classical Academy Roanoke](https://cornerstoneclassicalroanoke.org/).

Course Instructor: Stuart Bowman (e.g. [buffetboy2001 on GitHub](https://github.com/buffetboy2001), [faculty listing](https://cornerstoneclassicalroanoke.org/stuart-bowman))

## Course Goals

A basic instruction to the interdisciplinary world of robotics will be covered. Students are not expected to have any technical background at all, but will learn little-by-little along the way using hands-on projects.

We'll cover:

* Robotics Overview
* Introduction the Raspberry Pi computer
* Introduction to the Python programming language
* Introduction to electronics
* And...we'll build a [simple buggy!](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/build-a-buggy)
* And...then we'll make it [drive on its own!](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rpi-python-line-following).

## Build Guide

Take a look at the [build guide](./resources/build_guide.md).

## Class Discussions

* Python Computer Language: Intro >> [here](./resources/slides_python_intro.slides.html)
* Algorithms: Intro >> [here](./resources/slides_algorithms_intro.slides.html)

## Python Code

Working python code for the Raspberry Pi is [in the src folder](./src/CodeReadme.md).

And, here's a [cheat sheet](./resources/robotics_cheat_sheet.md) for robotics functions, too!

## Syllabus

Take a look at the [course syllabus](./resources/syllabus.md).

## Itemized List

Take a look at the [component Excel sheet](./resources/component_sheet.xlsx).

## Extra Credit

Want to take your project further? Consider these fun tasks:

* Make the vehicle turn in a circle
* Make the vehicle turn a precise 90 degree turn
* Add more line sensors (create a sensor array) and make the robot follow the line more precisely.
* Make the robot plot and follow a square and end up close to where it started -- this is challenging and may require [more sensors!](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/sense-hat/).

## Success!
