# Code Guide

A quick guide to the code here.

**TL;DR**: If you just want the solution, check out: [line_following_functions.py](./line_following_functions.py).

All code is in Python3 ![](../resources/pics/python_thumbnail_small.jpg)

| Source File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [90_deg_turn.py](./90_deg_turn.py) | Test code to create a 90 degree turn |
| [backward.py](./backward.py) | Go backwards |
| [circle_right.py](./circle_right.py)      | Test code to go in a circle |
| [follow_line.py](./follow_line.py)       | An attempt to make a more advanced control law, but not based on mathematics. Doesn't work so well. :( |
| [forward.py](./forward.py) | Go forward |
| [line_following_functions.py](./line_following_functions.py) | Follow a black line on a white surface. This uses functions to make it really clear where to fill in code for each control situation. |
| [line_following_simple.py](./line_following_simple.py) | The most basic version of line-following. Works reasonably well! |
| [robby.py](./robby.py) | Just another test script |
| [setup.py](./setup.py) | Used this to make creating the robot object repeatable across scripts. |
| [shutdown.py](./shutdown.py) | Shutdown the Raspberry Pi using python 3 code |
| [square.py](./square.py) | Make a square |
| [stay_in_white_space.py](./stay_in_white_space.py) | An attempt to stay inside a white space bounded by a black line. |
